    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor-website/banners/_facebook/boole-technology-centre.jpg" width="800" height="400">
<p>So the place that I chose was Cursor, I was supposed to go to them in 2020, but because of COVID,
    I didn't have the chance to. </p>
<p>So as soon as I got to Cursor on my first day, I went straight to reception and the person at the 
    desk was so lovely and they rang up the person that I discussed to about doing work experience with
    and then he came through the doors and met me and I met him and he showed me where I would be working
    for the next week and then from that moment until Wednesday, I have been making this website and I
    have been doing some other work on Codecademy. link below.

<p>So figure 1 below shows the skills that I have got so far with work experience.</p>
<p>So, I am on day 3 of my work experience and so far, I have shown the staff at Cursor
    that I have got a very good understanding of: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am really enjoying the work experience so far becuase I have been doing so well
        and also becuase I have met such nice people at Cursor.</p>
