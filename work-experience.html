    <p>So the place that I chose was Cursor, I was supposed to go to them in 2020, but because of COVID,
        I didn't have the chance to. </p>
    <p>So as soon as I got to Cursor on my first day, I went straight to reception and the person at the
        desk was so lovely and they gave me a lanyard to wear whilst I was there and then they rang up Daniel Westlake, the person that I discussed to about doing work experience with
        and then a short while later he came through the doors and I met him and he showed me where I would be working
        for the next week and I met the members of the team: Hadi, Nick, Sean and Daniel, there is more people in the team, but they were absent for the week and worked at home. So, 
        for the week, the plan was to get a website up and running, so from the start, I did of codecademy and I learnt the basics, then I applied what I knew to make a start, then 
        from that moment I kept on going on Codecademy and then applying it to my website.

    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <div class="my-skills">
        <p>HTML</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="skills html">100%</div>
        </div>

        <p>CSS</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="skills css">100%</div>
        </div>

        <p>JavaScript</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="skills js">25%</div>
        </div>

        <p>PHP</p>
        <div class="container">

    </div>

    <p>Figure 1</p>
    <p>So figure 1 (above) shows the skills that I have learnt from work experience.</p>
    <p>So from reading the table, it shows that I have shown the staff at Cursor
        that I have got a very good understanding of: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have really enjoyed work experience because I have been doing so well
        and also becuase I have met such nice people at Cursor.</p>
