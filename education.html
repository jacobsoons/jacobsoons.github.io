    <h2>Washingborough Academy</h2>

    <p>I was at Washingborough Academy from 2008 - 2016 and throughout my time there I did
        lots of things at Washingborough but if I had to say one thing about Washingborough
        Academy, I think it would be PGL. PGL was a trip that I went on with 40 other pupils
        and several members of staff and we had an amazing time. The things I did there was:
    <ul>
        <li>Going down a zipline</li>
        <li>Having a disco on the final night
        <li>Doing army cadet activities</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> And lots more. So after my last year of Washingborough Academy. I moved to Branston
        Community Academy.
    </p>
    <h2>Branston Community Academy</h2>

        width="600" height="400">

    <p>I started Branston from 2016 - 2021 and throughout my 5 years there I have studied
        lots of subjects, so from year 7 - year 9 I studied all of the subjects, so they were:
    <ul>
        <li>English - English Langauge and Literature</li>
        <li>Maths</li>
        <li>Science - Biology, Chemistry and phyiscs</li>
        <li>Religious Stuides</li>
        <li>Geography</li>
        <li>History</li>
        <li>Physical Education</li>
        <li>Food and Nutrition</li>
        <li>Art and Design</li>
        <li>Design Technology</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So they were all of the subjects that I started off learning between year 7 - year 9.
        <br>
        <br>
        So when I started in year 10, I was able to choose the subjects that I wanted to study and look
        into more because at this stage I was thinking that I would love to be a graphic/web designer,
        so from year 10 - year 11 all of the subjects that I would be studying I would need to do GCSE exams at the end,
        so I had to take:
    <ul>
        <li>English - English Langauge and Literature</li>
        <li>Maths</li>
        <li>Science - Biology, Chemistry and phyiscs</li>
        <li>Religious Stuides</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Then I chose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GCSE Imedia</li>
        <li>GCSE Art Graphics</li>
        <li>GCSE Food and Nutrition</li>
        <li>GCSE Geography</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So from the start of year 10 - year 11 I was studying my chosen subjects and grades I got from
        them were:
    <ul>
        <li>GCSE Maths - Grade 4</li>
        <li>GCSE English Langauge and Literature - Grade 4</li>
        <li>GCSE Combined Science - Grade 3</li>
        <li>GCSE Religious Studies - Grade 2</li>
        <li>GCSE Geography - Grade 3</li>
        <li>GCSE Food and Nutrition - Grade 5</li>
        <li>GCSE Imedia - Grade Level 2 Pass</li>
        <li>GCSE Art Graphics - Grade 7</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So after my GCSEs I had the choice to go to College or I could stay on at Branston and do Sixth
        Form and I chose Sixth Form.
        <br>
        <br>
