                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Jacob Soons, this is my portfolio website, this is going to talk
                    about myself and what I have achieved in the last few years. So just to talk about
                    myself to start with, I am very passionate about a lot of things but I think one of
                    the main things I like is supporting Lincoln City Football Club, I follow the imps home
                    and away.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another thing that I enjoy doing is creating and uploading videos on my two youtube channels.
                    I started youtube between 6-7 years ago, but the first channel I made wasn't good enough for my
                    liking so I deleted it and then I made two new ones called 'SpooneyYT' and 'SpooneyPlays' if you
                    want to read more about my youtube hobby, then just click on the 'Hobbies and Interests' page.

                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p> I was born on 13th March 2005, Leicester and when I was born me and my family
                    moved to Lincoln, more specifically, Washingborough. Couple of months after we
                    moved into Washingborough, I started going to the nursey at Washingborough Academy. I
                    really enjoyed it there becuase I was doing lots of activities . In 2008, I
                    started my first year at Washingborugh Academy.
