    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jacob Soons, this is my portfolio website, this is going to talk 
        about myself and what I have achieved in the last few years. So just to talk about 
        myself to start with, I am very pasionate about a lot of things but I think one of 
        the main thing I like is supporting Lincoln City Football Club, I follow the imps home 
        and away.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another thing that I enjoy doimng is creating and uploading videos on my two youtube channels.
        I started youtube between 6-7 years ago, but the first channel I made wasn't good enough for my
        liking so I deleted it and then I made two new ones called 'SpooneyYT' and 'SpooneyPlays' if you 
        want to read more about my youtube hobby, then just click on the 'Hobbies and Interests' page.
    </p>
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
    <p> I was born on 13th March 2005, Leicester and when I was born me and my family
        moved to Lincoln, more specifically, Washingborugh. Couple of months after we 
        moved into Washingborugh, I started going to the nursey at Washingborugh Academy. I 
        really enjoyed it there becuase I was doing lots of activities . In 2008, I 
        started my first year at Washingborugh Academy.
