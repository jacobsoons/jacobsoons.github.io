    <p>So this is my Sixth Form page. This is where I will talk about what I am currently
        learning. </p>
    <h2>Sixth Form</h2>

    <p>So at the start of Sixth Form, I was able to choose what subjects I wanted to do
        so I chose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>OCR Level 3 Diploma in IT Techinals</li>
        <li>Art and Design | Graphics</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So as I am writing this, it is nearly the end of my first year as a sixth former
        and I have learnt lots of new things, becuase in ICT, I have been learning lots of
        different units including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unit 1 - Fundementals of IT</li>
        <li>Unit 6 - Application Design </li>
        <li>Unit 9 - Product Development</li>
        <li>Unit 8 - Project Management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Also, in art I have done two projects so far and they are a consume project, so we got
        the term 'consume' and we had to base a project around it. The path that I went down was
        about healthy eating and for a final piece I did a poster and a leaflet. Then we moved onto
        another project, but it was a skills project and we had lots of different themes that we could
        choose but in the end I chose to base the project on colour. At the moment, in art I am starting work
        on my Y13 project and the Y13 project I am doing it is going to be about healthy eating/gaming becuase I
        enjoy gaming, so hopefully the end result could be something like me making a game cover or a poster on why
        it is good to eat healthy.
