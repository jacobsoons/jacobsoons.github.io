    <p>This is my Hobbies and Interests page. This is where I will talk about my current 
        hobbies and what I like doing.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <h3>Football</h3>
    <p>So one of my hobbies is that I like to watch Lincoln City play home and away. I have
        been supporting them for over 6 years and I have had some of the best experiences a 
        football fan will ever experience. I witnessed Lincoln City beat premier league Burnley
        in the FA Cup 5th Round at Turf Moor and Lincoln was the first non league side to reach
        the FA Cup quarter finals for over 103 years.</p>

    <p>Another amazing football experience I have witnessed was when Lincoln City reached Wembley
        and won the Checkatrade trophy in 2018 agianst Shrewsbury Town, thanks to Elliot Whitehouse
        with the only goal of the game.</p>

    <h3>Youtube</h3>
    <p>So another hobby of mine is Youtube. I started youtube for the first time in late 2018 and I 
        called my first youtube channel 'Jacob Soons', so I uploaded videos and the most viewed video 
        was 1.2k views, but then I decided to take it to the next level, so I deleted that channel and 
        I made two new ones called 'SpooneyYT' and 'SpooneyPlays'. So if I speak about my SpooneyYT
        channel first, so this is my main channel and I still have this channel to this day and on this 
        channel I upload football, walking, and other types of videos and on this channel I have 92 
        subscribers and the most viewed video is one called 'Norwich City v Lincoln City Highlights'
        and it has got 2k views which is mind blowing. So, moving onto SpooneyPlays. This channel is 
        dedicated to xbox gmaing, such as FIFA 22, Minecraft and lots more games, so onthis channel the
        most viewed video is called 'Mario Balotelli Bags Hatrick as AC Monza Win Versus Parma' and this
        this video has got 461 views and to be honest, for a gaming channel, that is prettyy good, but it 
        could do with being improved.
